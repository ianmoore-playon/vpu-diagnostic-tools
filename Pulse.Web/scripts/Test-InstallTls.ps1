.SYNOPSIS
    Installer-time SSL-interception diagnosis for failed bootstrap downloads.
.DESCRIPTION
    Called by run.bat when a first-run download fails (embedded Python from
    www.python.org, get-pip.py from bootstrap.pypa.io, packages from PyPI).
    Completes a TLS handshake to each host while accepting ANY certificate,
    then validates the certificate actually presented against the machine's
    trust store. A cert that doesn't chain to a trusted root means a firewall
    doing SSL deep-packet inspection is substituting certificates -- the
    SEC_E_UNTRUSTED_ROOT failure the Kent School District install hit -- so
    print a plain-English explanation naming the intercepting device instead
    of leaving the tech with a raw schannel error.

    Runs before Pulse (and its Python) exists, so it must stay dependency-free
    and print human text, not JSON. Pulse's own Test-TlsInspection.ps1 is the
    full runtime equivalent; keep their classification logic in sync.
.PARAMETER TargetHosts
    Comma-separated hostnames that just failed to download.
.NOTES
    Exit codes: 0 = no interception seen (or hosts unreachable), 2 = at least
    one host presented a substituted certificate.
